Hi, it's Marie from Markprompt!

I'm excited to announce one of our most requested features: **instant search integration**, powered by **Algolia**!

You can now combine LLM prompts with instant search in a single tab-based dialog, because sometimes a quick lookup is more suited than asking a question, and vice versa.

![LLM + instant search](https://res.cloudinary.com/djp21wtxm/image/upload/v1689863941/i1280x832-akCka5S9wTLn_y8s4sa.png)

To add search to your prompt, head over to the [Markprompt playground](https://markprompt.com) → enable instant search → paste your Algolia keys. That's all it takes! Read more [in our blog post](https://markprompt.com/blog/algolia).

We are just getting started with our vision of building a **copilot for docs**: expert tools and APIs to create and maintain content at scale. **What else would you like to see?**

Thank you,

Marie ☀️

CEO and co-founder of Markprompt
