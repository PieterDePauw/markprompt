Hi, it's Marie from Markprompt!

Happy to announce **Insights**. In the dashboard, we've added:

- 📄 Source inspection
- 👍 Upvotes/downvotes/unanswered status
- 📚 Most cited sources
- 💌 Weekly email reports

![Insights](https://res.cloudinary.com/djp21wtxm/image/upload/v1692986961/F2Ef2vEbkAA2GHq_nvpwru.jpg)

Insights data is also exposed via API, so that you can ingest it in your data warehouse (e.g. [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/)) and analytics tools (e.g. [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) and [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/)). Read more about it [in our docs](https://markprompt.com/docs#insights).

With Insights, we are creating the first brick of the **human-in-the-loop** part of Markprompt, allowing you to take informed action to improve your docs. **What else would you like to see?**

Have a great week-end,

Marie ☀️

CEO and co-founder of Markprompt
